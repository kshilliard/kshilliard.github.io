    attending <span style="color:yellow;background:blue;font-weight: bold">North Carolina A&T State University</span>. He will graduate in December 2020 at
    19 years old. Kevin's main interests are in gaming; ever since he played the
    <span style="color:white;background:rebeccapurple;font-weight: bold">Game Boy Advance</span> at age six, he has been intrigued not just by the actions
    and events on screen, <u>but also the internal workings and development processes of video games</u>. Thus, he is pursuing a career in game design
    and directing, choosing <i>Computer Science</i> as his major to give him the abilities needed to become a full-time video game developer and designer,
    with the ability to come up with ideas that will shake the video game industry and program them to be stable and enjoyable for all audiences.</p>
